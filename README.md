# Data-Engineering-Intern-Project-Assignment
# Stock Data ETL Project

This is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project for stock data. The project extracts stock data from APIs, transforms it, and loads it into a MySQL database. I created this project as part of an internship assignment.

---
## Project Overview
The ETL pipeline is structured in three stages:

1. Extract: Pulls raw stock data from external APIs or data sources.  
2. Transform: Cleans and preprocesses the data to make it ready for analysis or database storage.  
3. Load: Inserts the transformed data into a MySQL database.

This modular approach ensures code clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility.

pandas – for data manipulation.
requests – for API requests.
